These are two twitterbots that simulate game calls by White Sox and Chicago Cubs announcers.
The program utilizes the mlbgame package, which is a Python API that retrieves and read MLB GameDay data. As cited in its docs, "mlbgame uses the same data that MLB GameDay uses, and therefore is updated as soon as something happens in a game."

## Harry Caray bot

The account tweets via the main program when there is a final score, when a Cub player hits a home run and a recent Chicago Tribune headline in the fourth inning. 
There also is a side program that tweets birthdays from the roster stats and relevant celebrity birthdays.
